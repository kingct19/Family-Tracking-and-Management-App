# 🎨 TAILWIND CSS FIX - Custom Classes Issue

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. CSS Import Order
- **Fixed**: Moved `@import` statements before `@tailwind` directives
- **Reason**: CSS imports must come before Tailwind directives

### 2. Custom Typography Classes
- **Problem**: `text-display-lg` classes weren't recognized by Tailwind
- **Solution**: Replaced with standard Tailwind classes (`text-6xl`, `text-5xl`, etc.)

### 3. Custom Color Classes
- **Problem**: Custom color classes weren't working
- **Solution**: Replaced with standard Tailwind colors (`text-purple-600`, `bg-blue-500`, etc.)

### 4. Custom Elevation Classes
- **Problem**: `shadow-elevation-1` classes weren't recognized
- **Solution**: Replaced with standard Tailwind shadows (`shadow-sm`, `shadow-lg`, etc.)

## 🔧 How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Test Simple Page
1. Go to: **http://localhost:3002/simple-test**
2. **Should see**: Red background, white text, colored boxes
3. **If working**: Tailwind CSS is processing correctly

### Step 2: Test HomePage
1. Go to: **http://localhost:3002/**
2. **Should see**: Styled homepage with colors and layout
3. **If working**: All custom classes are working

### Step 3: Check Console
- **Should see**: No more "unknown utility class" errors
- **Should see**: CSS processing without errors

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Simple Test Page
- ✅ Red background (`bg-red-500`)
- ✅ White text (`text-white`)
- ✅ Blue box with rounded corners (`bg-blue-500 rounded-lg`)
- ✅ Green circle (`bg-green-500 rounded-full`)
- ✅ Grid layout with colored boxes
- ✅ Purple button with hover effect

### HomePage

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Option 1: Check Server

### Option 2: Hard Refresh
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
