# Firebase Security Rules Fix

## Problem
The current Firestore security rules are too strict for initial development. They require:
1. Hub memberships to exist before reading hubs
2. Complex role checks that fail for new users
3. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem where users can't create their first hub

## Solution: Use Development Rules

I've created simplified security rules in `firestore.rules.dev` that allow:
- ✅ Authenticated users to read/write their own user documents
- ✅ Authenticated users to create and read hubs
- ✅ Hub members to update/delete their hubs
- ✅ All authenticated users to read/write hub subcollections

## Deploy Development Rules

### Option 1: Firebase Console (Easiest)

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   - https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select your project

2. **Navigate to Firestore Database:**
   - Click "Firestore Database" in left sidebar
   - Click "Rules" tab

3. **Copy and Paste the Development Rules:**
   - Open `firestore.rules.dev` in your editor
   - Copy ALL the contents
   - Paste into the Firebase Console Rules editor
   - Click **"Publish"**

4. **Verify:**
   - You should see "Rules published successfully"
   - Rules are now active

### Option 2: Firebase CLI

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/chandlerking/Family-Tracking-and-Management-App

# Backup current rules
cp firestore.rules firestore.rules.backup

# Replace with development rules
cp firestore.rules.dev firestore.rules

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# If you don't have Firebase CLI:
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase use --add  # Select your project
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Option 3: Manual Copy

```bash
# Just copy the dev rules to production rules file
cp firestore.rules.dev firestore.rules

# Then deploy via Firebase Console or CLI
```

## After Deploying

1. **Refresh your browser** (hard refresh):
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Application → Storage
   - Click "Clear site data"
   - Close DevTools
   - Refresh page

3. **Try logging in again**

You should now see:
- ✅ No permission-denied errors
- ✅ Hub created automatically
- ✅ Map loads successfully
- ✅ Hub name shows in top bar

## Verify Rules Are Active

**Check in Firebase Console:**
1. Firestore Database → Rules tab
2. Look for the timestamp "Published [time] ago"
3. Verify the rules match `firestore.rules.dev`

**Check in browser console:**
- Should see: "Default hub created successfully"
- Should NOT see: "permission-denied" errors

## Production Rules (Later)

Once everything is working, you can:
1. Restore the original strict rules from `firestore.rules.backup`
2. Or gradually add back permission checks as needed
3. Test each rule change carefully

The development rules are meant for **testing only**. For production:
- Re-enable membership checks
- Add role-based permissions
- Restrict hub creation
- Validate all writes

## Current Rule Differences

### Development Rules (firestore.rules.dev):
```javascript
// Simple: Any authenticated user can create hubs
allow read, create: if isAuthenticated();

// Simple: Hub members can update
allow update: if request.auth.uid in resource.data.members;
```

### Production Rules (firestore.rules):
```javascript
// Complex: Requires membership document to exist
allow read: if isHubMember(hubId) && isMembershipActive(hubId);

// Complex: Checks role and membership status
allow update: if isHubAdmin(hubId) && isMembershipActive(hubId);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Rules deployed but still getting errors?

**Clear Firestore cache:**
```bash
# In browser DevTools Console:
indexedDB.deleteDatabase('firebaseLocalStorageDb')
```

Then refresh the page.

### Can't deploy rules via CLI?

Use **Option 1** (Firebase Console) - it's easier and works immediately.

### Still getting permission errors?

1. Check Firebase Console → Rules tab - verify rules are published
2. Wait 30 seconds for rules to propagate
3. Hard refresh browser
4. Clear browser cache completely
5. Try incognito/private browsing mode

**Status:** Development rules created in `firestore.rules.dev`  
**Action Needed:** Deploy rules using one of the options above  
**Expected Result:** Map loads, hub created, no permission errors
